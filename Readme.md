Deep Learning Projects | 

1. Image Classification Using Deep Learning

Description: Developed an image classification model utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately categorize images into predefined classes.​
Technologies: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV​
Responsibilities:
Preprocessed and augmented image datasets to enhance model generalization.​
Designed and trained a CNN architecture, achieving high accuracy on test data.​
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.​

2. Image Denoising with Autoencoders

Description: Implemented an autoencoder-based model to remove noise from images, improving visual clarity and quality.​
Technologies: Python, PyTorch, NumPy​
Responsibilities:
Generated noisy images by adding various noise types to clean images.​
Developed and trained an autoencoder to reconstruct clean images from noisy inputs.​
Assessed the denoising effectiveness using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).​
